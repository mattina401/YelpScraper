# YelpScraper

Using Java FX to build a GUI application that works as a web crawler/scraper to gather information off from the html files sent from Yelp site, stores the collected data in a database, and displays the processed result in efficient style. Java FX makes it easy for us to design our project in MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern where we can effectively create and integrate both user interactive parts and backend process parts. The model part of our MVC pattern will need to have a connection to a database where we can store our data. For our database, we have decided to use Mongo DB, the NOSQL Document-oriented database. Its basic data structure is BSON, and like the well-known JSON, it allows us to store array data in a document without restriction of filling up all the field values.
